					Minecraft is a sandbox game that allows players to build and explore infinite worlds.
				With two distinct game modes—Creative, where you can build and explore without limits, and Survival, where you gather resources to build and maintain health—you have the freedom to play the game your way.
				The game also features multiplayer support, enabling you to team up with friends and explore together.
